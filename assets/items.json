Doesn't apply to progress items like The Polaroid\nWhen you pick up an item that increases your maximum HP, you gain 2 permanent stat increases, and a temporary damage boost that slowly goes down over time. Starts at +3.6 damage and goes to 0 after 30 seconds\nWhile this temporary damage boost is active, each enemy you kill increases your damage slightly, allowing you to quickly kill multiple enemies and chain the effect for longer\nThis item also gives a -0.03 Speed Down for every food item held\nThe 2 permanent stat increases depend on the item taken:\nA Snack = +0.2 shot speed, +1 luck. Breakfast = +0.2 shot speed, +1.5 Range. Dessert = +1 Flat Damage, +0.2 shot speed. Dinner = +0.5 tears, +0.2 shot speed.\nLunch = +0.5 tears, +1.5 range. Midnight Snack = +1 flat damage, +1 luck.
